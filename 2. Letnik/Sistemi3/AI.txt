An informational system where you can rent "friends" would allow users to search for and connect with individuals who are available to spend time with them and provide companionship. The system would likely include profiles for each "friend" that includes information about their interests and availability, as well as a way for users to book time with them. The purpose of the system is to provide individuals with the opportunity to have companionship and social interaction without the commitment of a traditional friendship or romantic relationship.
